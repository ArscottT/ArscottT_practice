Hi!
My name is Tom Arscott.

Over the past few years I have had a broad array of experience in different industry sectors. To name a few companies: [Selex ES](http://www.uk.leonardocompany.com/) (which is now called FinSelMecainia to those in the know), [Pioneers](https://Pioneers.io) and [Infarm](https://www.infarm.de)

My passion lies with FPGA's and VHDL however my life has taken a waving path at the moment.

More information can be found through either [LinkedIn](https://at.linkedin.com/in/thomas-arscott-5b3184b8). Or the CV page if you like the website that much.

I am currently working on my portfolio with the aim of pursuing a more freelance career.
