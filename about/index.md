Hi!

My name is Tom Arscott. I am a avid developer and and insatiable explorer.

Over the past few years I have had a broad array of experience in different industry sectors. From defence systems with [Selex ES](http://www.uk.leonardocompany.com/) to startup/ technology analysis with [Pioneers](https://Pioneers.io). And recently I have started traveling the world and discovered a love of culture and craziness.

With this in mind I decided to become a digital nomad and aim for a 'life without limits'. Cheesey I know, but you have to aim high. The first step was to start a freelance career, the next to was to take a plane with a one way ticket. My life has never been the same since.

A portfolio is important as a developer, so currently this is the main focus of my time. My work so far can be seen under the projects page, and I will be adding to this as I progress.     

I have also started a blog to record the lessons I learn as I continue on this course. So feel free to head over and read about my journey.
