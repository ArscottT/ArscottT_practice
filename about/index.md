Hi!

My name is Tom Arscott. I am a passionate developer and and insatiable explorer.

Over the past few years I have had a broad array of experience in different industry sectors. From defence systems ([Selex ES](http://www.uk.leonardocompany.com/)) to startup analysis ([Pioneers](https://Pioneers.io)). And recently I have started traveling the world and discovered a love of new places.

With these in mind I decided to become a digital nomad and aim for a life without limits. The first step was to start a freelance career, the next to was to take a plane with a one way ticket. My life has never been the same since.

Currently I am working on my portfolio in order to further show my developer talent.    

Please contact me if you would like to know more.
